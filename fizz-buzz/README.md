# Context
Imagine the scene. You are eleven years old, and in the five minutes before the end of the lesson, your Maths teacher decides he should make his class more "fun" by introducing a "game".

He explains that he is going to point at each pupil in turn and ask them to say the next number in sequence, starting from one. The "fun" part is that if the number is divisible by three, you instead say "Fizz" and if it is divisible by five you say "Buzz". 

So now your maths teacher is pointing at all of your classmates in turn, and they happily shout "one!", "two!", "Fizz!", "four!", "Buzz!"... until he very deliberately points at you, fixing you with a steely gaze... time stands still, your mouth dries up, your palms become sweatier and sweatier until you finally manage to croak "Fizz!". Doom is avoided, and the pointing finger moves on.

So of course in order to avoid embarrassment in front of your whole class, you have to get the full list printed out so you know what to say. Your class has about 33 pupils and he might go round three times before the bell rings for break time. Next maths lesson is on Thursday. Get coding!

# Goal
- Write a program that returns the numbers from 1 to 100
- But for multiples of three returns "Fizz" instead of the number
- For the multiples of five returns "Buzz"
- For the multiples of fifteen returns "FizzBuzz"


# Sample output

	1
	2
	Fizz
	4
	Buzz
	Fizz
	7
	8
	Fizz
	Buzz
	11
	Fizz
	13
	14
	FizzBuzz
	16
	17
	Fizz
	19
	Buzz
	... etc up to 100

# After the pause... New requirements

 - A number is Fizz if it has a 3 in it
 - A number is Buzz if it has a 5 in it
 - A number is FizzBuzz if
 	- it has a 3 in it
 	- it has a 5 in it

 - The previous requirements are still correct.
