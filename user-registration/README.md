## Goal
Create the functionality using Unit tests and test doubles.

## Requirements
First iteration requirements:
- The input of the method has an email and a password.
- Validate that the user is persisted.
- The userId is randomly generated.

Second iteration requirements:
- Cannot exist two users with the same email.
- Password should meet security requirements.
  - Has more than 8 characters.
  - Contains an underscore.
- Sends the confirmation email when user is registered

## Remember
